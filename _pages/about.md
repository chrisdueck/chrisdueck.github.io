Hi, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Avco Systems in Slough, UK. My work spans
the whole development lifecycle, from scoping out new projects, producing
requirement specifications and designs, all the way through to implementation,
testing and deployment.

I graduated from the **University of Surrey** in 2021, having attained a first class
**BSc (Hons) Computer Science** (91%), including a strong 80% grade in my
dissertation: _Experimental Analysis of View Synchronisation in Byzantine Consensus (a hot area of
distributed systems research).

In 2019, I was awarded the **Gold-i Prize** as the top-performing student in my
second year module *Further Programming Paradigms*, which covered advanced OOP
in _C++_, Functional Programming in _Haskell_ and Logic Programming in _Prolog_.

Before graduating, I also completed a placement year with _Xceptor_, a web-based
process automation platform that powers many of the big names in finance around
the world. As a Software Engineer, I worked in an Scrum team primarily using
_C#_, _AngularJS_ and _SQL Server_ to develop new features and bug fixes, as
well as helping with deployments, support and performance testing.

Whenever I have enough free time, I like working on my own coding projects, some
of which you can read about [here.](/projects/) I hope to update this more soon.

Before I went to university, I spent a lot of my time with the _Royal Air Force
Air Cadets_, where I was a **Cadet Warrant Officer** and staff cadet at 2402
(Burghfield) squadron. As well as flight experience, I gained a range of skills
such as effective teamwork, communication, time management and leadership.

In 2016, I was a regional finalist for the _CVQO Duke of Westminster_ award. As
part of this competition I completed an **ILM Level 3 Certificate** in
Leadership and Team Management, and was elected to become the **CVQO Regional
Ambassador** for the southern UK - a role where I promoted the benefits of
vocational qualifications to cadets throughout the south for the next year.

Around that time, I also undertook several long distance hikes in support of
charity, namely the [RAFA](https://www.rafa.org.uk/), the
[JTYAF](https://www.jtyaf.org/) and [CALM](https://www.thecalmzone.net/). The
hikes took place in the Brecon Beacons, on the Ridgeway and through Dartmoor.
Nowadays my hobbies include gaming and working out at home. I
also play the guitar/keyboard on occasion, and can solve Rubik's cubes
_reasonably_ quickly (see above)!
