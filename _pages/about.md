Hi, I'm Software Engineer at Avco Systems in Slough, UK. My work spans the whole
development lifecycle, from scoping out new projects to produce specifications
and designs, all the way through to implementation, testing and deployment.

I graduated from the University of Surrey in 2021, having attained a first class
**BSc (Hons) in Computer Science** (91%), including a strong 80% grade in my
dissertation on Byzantine Consensus (an area of distributed systems research).

In 2019, I received the **Gold-i Prize** as the highest-performing student in my
second year module *Further Programming Paradigms*, which covered advanced OOP
in C++, Functional Programming in Haskell and Logic Programming in Prolog.

I also completed a placement year as a full-time Software Engineer at Xceptor,
where I worked in an agile scrum team, primarily using _C#_, _AngularJS_ and
_SQL Server_ to develop new features for a large web-based automation platform
used internationally by large financial clients.

Whenever I have enough free time, I like working on my own coding projects, some
of which you can read about [here.](/projects/) I hope to update this more soon.

Before I got to university, I spent a lot of my time with the Royal Air Force
Air Cadets, where I was a Cadet Warrant Officer and staff cadet at 2402 
(Burghfield) squadron. As well as flight experience, I gained a range of skills
such as effective teamwork, communication, time management and leadership.

In 2016, I was a regional finalist for the CVQO Duke of Westminster award. As
part of this competition I completed an ILM Level 3 certificate in Leadership
and Team Management, and was elected to become the CVQO Regional Ambassador for
the southern UK - a role where I promoted the benefits of vocational
qualifications to cadets throughout the south for the next year.

Around that time, I also undertook several long distance hikes in support of
charity, namely the [RAFA](https://www.rafa.org.uk/), the
[JTYAF](https://www.jtyaf.org/) and [CALM](https://www.thecalmzone.net/). The
hikes took place in the Brecon Beacons, on the Ridgeway and through Dartmoor.
Nowadays my hobbies include gaming and working out at ~~the gym~~ **home**. I
also play the guitar/keyboard on occasion, and can solve Rubik's cubes
_reasonably_ quickly (see above)!
