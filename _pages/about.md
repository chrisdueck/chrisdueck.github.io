I'm a student at the University of Surrey, studying for a BSc (Hons) Computer
Science. So far I'm on track to achieve a first class degree, with an average of
87% in my second year. At university I've worked as a Student Ambassador and Lab
Demonstrator, as well as volunteering as a course representative for my cohort.

In 2019 I was lucky enough to receive the Gold-i Prize for achieving the highest
performance in my second year module 'Further Programming Paradigms', which
covered advanced OOP in C++, Functional Programming in Haskell and Logic
Programming in Prolog.

I recently completed a placement year as a full-time Software Engineer at Xceptor, where I
worked primarily with *C#, AngularJS and SQL Server* to develop new features for a
large web-based automation platform used by global financial clients.

Whenever I've got enough free time, I like working on my own coding projects,
some of which you can read about [here.](/projects/) I hope to update this more
soon.

Before I got to University, I spent a lot of my time with the Royal Air Force
Air Cadets, where I was a Cadet Warrant Officer and the most senior
cadet on my squadron. As well as flight experience, I gained a range of skills
such as effective teamwork, communication, time management and leadership.

In 2016, I was a regional finalist for the CVQO Duke of Westminster award. As
part of this competition I completed an ILM Level 3 certificate in Leadership
and Team Management, and was elected to become the CVQO Regional Ambassador for
the southern UK - a role where I promoted the benefits of vocational
qualifications to cadets throughout the south for the next year.

Around that time, I also undertook several long distance hikes in support of
charity, namely the [RAFA](https://www.rafa.org.uk/), the
[JTYAF](https://www.jtyaf.org/) and [CALM](https://www.thecalmzone.net/). The
hikes took place in the Brecon Beacons, on the Ridgeway and through Dartmoor.

My more recent hobbies include gaming and the occasional spot of physical
exercise at the gym. I can also play the guitar and solve Rubik's cubes reasonably
quickly, though I don't do either very often anymore!
