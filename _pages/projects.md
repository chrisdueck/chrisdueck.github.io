  Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) theme

## Unity Ball Bouncing Game
*Side Project, 2019*

Bounce a ball on the bar for as long as possible. Avoid the falling rocks,
bombs and skulls which will destroy you. Catch bonus lives to keep you in the
game for longer. Every 15 seconds the spawn rate of the obstacles will increase,
making the game progressively harder.

* Written in C# using free assets from the Unity Asset Store.
* Built for Android, controlled by touching either side of the screen.
* Includes sound and particle effects for all collisions.

  other images.

  area of caches you can open.
