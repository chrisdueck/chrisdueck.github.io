# Professional Experience

As a full stack developer, my work is typically split equally across frontend
and backend code. I have primarily worked with C# / .NET for the former (2 years
experience) and React or Angular with TypeScript for the latter.

When it comes to databases, I have experience with both SQL and NoSQL solutions.
During my placement year I worked frequently with Microsoft SQL Server, whereas
I now primarily use MongoDB. Check out my [certifications](#courses--certifications).

# School/University Project Experience

My programming journey began aged 12 when I taught myself to make (very!) basic
websites using resources I found online. I decided to take an A Level in
Computer Science where I eventually created a complete Air Cadet management
system using VB.NET, and achieved an A* grade overall.

At University, I worked on several niche projects, from building a code snippet
manager to creating a complete morse encoder-decoder in assembly on an Arduino.
You can read about some of these projects on the [projects page](/projects).
