# Professional Experience

As a full stack developer, my work is split fairly equally across frontend
and backend. In recent years I've primarily worked with C#/.NET, Go, React and
React Native.

I also have experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases, particularly MS-SQL
and MongoDB. I've even completed an associate developer certification with
Mongo, as well as a number of smaller courses. See the full list
[here](#courses--certifications).

# School/University Project Experience

I began programming aged 12, when I taught myself to make basic websites using
resources I found online. I decided to take an A Level in Computer Science where
I eventually created a complete Air Cadet management system using VB.NET, and
achieved an A* grade overall.

At University, I worked on several niche projects, from building a code snippet
manager to creating a complete morse encoder-decoder in assembly on an Arduino.
You can read about some of these projects on the [projects page](/projects).
